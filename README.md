Configuration:
If you get a warning from git
"LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it"

`git config --global core.autocrlf false`

`git config --global core.eol lf`

When using .ipynb files in the github, rendering must likly be an UNIX system which might not be able to render the .ipynb file which has windows supporting formatting
