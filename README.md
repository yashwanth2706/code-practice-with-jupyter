### Jupyter notebook based Python & Java code for DSA practice
- Easily manage both Python and Java code with Jupyter envirornment

Configuration:
If you get a warning from git (This likely can happen in Windows)
"LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it"

Configure git to support Unix like systems (Even when there is no warning)
(Recommended for managing .ipynb files)

`git config --global core.autocrlf false`

`git config --global core.eol lf`
